# Checkers-Game
a standart checkers game with all the rules and a UI 
*note* - the multyplayer (host and client) only works when the host and the client are running on the same computer(i decieded only to test it on my computer and i didnt add a relay
so you cant play on the same computer.
the reason is that i didnt want to fucos on multyplayer and wanted to move to other project.
so the multyplayer here is only a tester 
*hotseat does works*
